# Empty Platformer project

A platformer made with Unity, with basic mechanics. This repository is for education purposes, so you can use it as a template for you projects.

The main goal of this project is to add as much sign and feedbacks as possible to make a very simple platformer with only the basic moves the most insanely pleaseful to play.

For this exercise, the content is not useful. It's just a test environment with a static camera.
